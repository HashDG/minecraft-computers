# Minecraft Redstone Computers Schematics
Here's some Minecraft computers I made

To test these computers, you have to download a schematics Minecraft mod as [Schematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/schematica), [Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica), [World Edit](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit/)...
Then go in `.minecraft/config/<mod name>/schematics` or`.minecraft/schematics` it'll depends on the mod and the version.
And finally you can launch the game, and go in a minecraft world using the Schematics mod to load and print the schematic file.

## 1. Fibonacci
A compact computer made with an adder, two registers, and a sort of accumulator to manage output. The dashboard is three-parted:
- Manual Clock
- Automatic Clock
- Reset

The first enables the user to define the clock rate. Then the second enables an almost perfect defined clock rate. And the last is used to reset the whole computer.

Note: The highest lamp on the output symbolizes overflow.
